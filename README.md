### Level of Achievement:

Apollo

### Project Scope:

Notable will be a web application with databases of user profiles and notes. We will be using React, JavaScript, HTML and CSS to develop the web interface of Notable. While the backend and databases of user profiles and notes will be created and managed using Firebase. This will aid the incorporation of core features like “search by module code”, “create user profiles”, “sign in to a user profile” and “look up a user”, through an appealing user friendly interface. Notable is also intended to be usable by as many students as possible. Since users can search for notes by their titles, notes of practically any subject matter can be uploaded onto Notable for others to view.

### Project Description:

Notable is a web application supported by a database of user profiles and notes.
Notable will have a user interface that allows students to browse through seniors’ notes, to help aid their understanding of module content or to get inspired by them, to create their own notes that might then benefit their juniors. These functions are achieved through the core features mentioned below.

### Project Motivation:

Oftentimes when students are reading lecture slides, they might get ‘stuck’ at certain points when they are unable to make the connections between the steps taken by the professor in the slides. This might then require them to spend large amounts of time searching for answers online to try and figure out the crucial step or inference that is skipped in the lecture notes. Oftentimes this also ends up being a stepping off point where students give up because they haven’t been able to find the answers. Some students might turn to advice from their fellow students in the module or from experienced seniors/TAs, with some even obtaining summary notes from their seniors to ensure the module content is more digestible. This got us thinking about the opportunity to create an application to facilitate this process.

We realized that the university is filled with seniors who have been through the same experience that their juniors are struggling with and best of all, they probably have the missing puzzle piece that we desperately need, in order to understand the lecture content. Furthermore, some TAs may also prepare their own self-made notes for their students and wish to share those with them. Hence, we created Notable.

### Project aim:

Notable aims to simplify the process of learning by making it easier to find notes from seniors who have taken the same module and by making these notes easily accessible to students. We also aim to entice seniors to share their notes on this platform, so that the juniors can benefit from it and subsequently be keen on sharing their notes for the future batches of students.

### Proposed core features:

1. **Search by module code**
2. **Uploading of notes & tagging of notes using module code**
3. **Storage & hosting of notes on web server**
4. **User Profiles** - _Each user will have a profile, containing information regarding all the notes they’ve contributed_
5. **Accomplishment badges** - _To encourage users to contribute notes to Notable and is awarded to users for different levels of contributions_
6. **Rate & Review system** - _To allow students to rate and review notes that they've browsed, using a star review system and a comment feature_
7. **Refined Search** - _To allow users to search by most popular notes_

### User stories:

1. As a junior who has difficulty understanding certain topics in a module I am taking, I want to be able to fill in the gaps in my knowledge with notes from seniors who have aced those topics.

2. As a junior who is too shy to ask my seniors for the notes that they have made, I can search for notes from other seniors through Notable so that I can still obtain reliable notes to refer to, to clarify my doubts.

3. As a junior making my own notes, I can browse through notes from seniors on Notable, so that I can have a better understanding of key concepts or how to structure my own notes so that I can further my learning.

4. As a junior, I can search and preview notes for a module amongst various submissions to find the one that best suits my learning needs, so that I can further my understanding

5. As a junior who is trying to revise for a module’s exams, I can view summary notes from seniors who have done the exam preparations previously, so that I can ensure I have not missed out any content and ace the exam.

6. As a senior who has aced a module, I can submit my notes to Notable so that I can contribute to future batches taking the module.

7. As a senior who has completed modules and is taking more modules in the future, I can contribute my notes to Notable, so that I can contribute to a positive cycle, knowing that others may do the same for my future modules.

8. As a TA trying to teach my students, I want to be able to access other notes to share with my students so that I can teach them better, using information from different interpretations of the same content.

9. As a TA trying to teach my students, I can access other notes on Notable to value add to my current notes that I intend on giving to my students so that they can learn better.

10. As a TA, I can upload my own lesson notes to Notable, for all students (including those outside my tutelage) to view and refer to, in their learning

### Project design:

**Model View Controller (MVC) design:**

1. Controller captures mouse clicks and input from the user
2. This information is sent to the Model/Main which pulls from the Database and determines the next logic/action will be.
3. The View will display the new updated UI to the user.

**Components we need to include:**

1. Main
2. UI
3. Logic
4. Database

### Project plan:

1. Components (Main, UI, Logic, Database) are fully functional by 25 June.
2. Basic funcitionality including Search, Upload, Download to be available by 25 June.
3. Integrate User Profiles and Rate & Review System into the implementation by 20 July.
4. Proper testing of each newly added feature throughout the process to ensure it works.
